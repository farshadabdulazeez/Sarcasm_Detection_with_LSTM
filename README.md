# Sarcasm_Detection_with_LSTM
This project builds a sarcasm detection model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Trained on a manually generated dataset with sarcastic and non-sarcastic examples, it showcases text preprocessing, LSTM model training, and evaluation for sarcasm classification, providing insights into natural language understanding.
