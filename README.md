## Project Overview

This project aims to build a sarcasm detection model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, a deep learning technique designed to handle sequential data. The model is trained on a manually generated dataset containing both sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences. The objective is to classify sentences into sarcastic or non-sarcastic categories.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of a mix of sarcastic and non-sarcastic examples generated manually. It includes everyday scenarios where sarcasm or non-sarcasm can be easily identified. This dataset was used to train the model to recognize sarcasm in natural language.

## Model

The model uses an **LSTM** architecture, which is particularly effective for sequential data like text. The LSTM network is trained on the dataset to classify sentences as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
